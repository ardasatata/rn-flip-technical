# FLIP Technical React-Native Test

This is a Flip Technical React-Native test

## Note

- Utilize **typescript**
- Radio-Button Package a bit buggy (I run out of a time to built myself tho)
- Not using any lodash, date-fns, & simmilar library
- Separate the code by **modules**
- A bit overkill for this simple 2 screens app, but I put my years of learning RN in this test :D
- No State management library used
- Kinda follow some best practice from a few famous RN boilerplate
